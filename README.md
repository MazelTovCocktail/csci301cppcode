# csci301cppcode
Projects I worked on in CSCI 301

Code here is essentially an assortment of Abstract Data Types and random projects. Some of the code here should be modified, reformatted and/or rewritten into formal library functions. The is ADTs for linked lists, queues, stacks, heaps, binary search trees, recursive implmentations of some ADTs, and maybe a few others. The code here is mostly commented but most of it isnt really in a modular form. All the code here has compiled and worked on my windows machine but it hasnt been rigorously tested or widly used.
